> **_NOTE: Mutable and Immutable_**
Mutable objects are those that allow you to change their value or data in place without affecting the object's identity. In contrast, immutable objects don't allow this kind of operation. You'll just have the option of creating new objects of the same type with different values.

> **_NOTE: Shadowing_**
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = "T-H-R-E-E"; // don't change this line
    println!("Spell a Number : {}", number);
    let number = 3; // don't rename this variable
    println!("Number plus two is : {}", number + 2);
}
```
In the above program, variable `number` is considered as string and the same variable `number` reused as integer. Only thing we need to do is, use the `let` keyword. In this case, we cannot use `mut` keyword. As it denotes that the variable is mutable and value can be modified. In general, variables created using `let` are immutable.
