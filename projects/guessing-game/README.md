##### Practical programming project
* Programming a guessing game
    * the program will generate a random integer number between 1 to 100
    * User need to guess the number
    * After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high.
    * If the guess is correct, program will congratulate and then exit

* Outcomes of this project
    * You’ll learn about let, match, methods, associated functions, external crates, and more! 
    * In the following chapters, we’ll explore these ideas in more detail. 
    * In this chapter, you’ll just practice the fundamentals.
